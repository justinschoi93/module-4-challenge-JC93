## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://youtu.be/BFyeuLhjcPY)

I created an online quiz using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No starter code was used. The entire project was made from scratch. 




## Usage 

Click the start button start, click on the answer choice to choose an answer, click on the next button to move onto the next question, and the high scores button to view the high scores!

You will be rewarded 10 points for each correct answer, and deducted 5 seconds of quiz time for each incorrect answer. You may answer each question once per quiz.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Learning Points 

This project was the perfect opportunity to practice using HTML, CSS and javascript in conjunction with one another. I used HTML to design the skeleton of the website, javascript to make the website functional, and CSS to improve the UI experience for the person taking the quiz.
